        Sup. The names Benjamin Lee if you can't already tell, Though I prefer being called Benji so I don't blen in too much in the see of other Benjamins out there. I am a stunning male Asian boy 
      who was born in Milpitas California. Spent my school days mostly in Milpitas Christian School and The king's Acadamy. My favorite food is noodles and my favorite past time is drawing. </center><br>

        Currently attending San Jose State University pursuing a degree in Digital Media Art. I enjoy drawing and designing my own characters in my free time.
      Always enjoyed drawing as a kid and have been drawing my entire life. I'm still practicing on drawing in a digital format but I believe I'll get there one day. </center><br>
       <br><center>
        (P.S. I don't know how to code so I don't know how to add my projects to the portfolio tab. So I moved them here in the bio tab. Does my face look like the kind of guy who knows how to program.) </center><br>

        I was playing Dungeons & Dragons with my friends and I became very attached to my player character, a humnoid dragon who likes to play music. When it came time to describe my character, I ended up drawing him 
         before hand to show the others. Although the main foucus was to show off my character to my friends, this whole process was just me practicing on how to draw background. 
         The end result isn't too bad, though I believe I can do better

        I made this during me early years of highschool. The two characters shown are Bendy and Cuphead (left and right respectivly) and thy come from there video games with there respective names. I mainly made this 
           because the games were at there highsest during the time I drew this and I wanted to show my love for the two games in someway shape or form. I was also testing to see what would happen if I color my drawing 
           using sharpies on a canvas instead of paint. The end result is mediocre at best, though I do like how the character look as they seem pretty close to the original thing (minus the crude coloring).

        After finishing my senior year of highschool, I wanted to draw one last thing and show it to my digital desighn teacher who tought me how to use photoshop, zvrush, animation, app desighn, and so much more.
             I initally wanted to draw digitaly, though my skills on that field is very rusty. There is still more to learn if I want to achieve thatgoal. In the end I opt out in drawing a character base of leassons I 
             learned from my teacher. I wanted to make a character with reason behind it, giving them a background of what they do, why it's desigh the way it is, and how to covey all that to the viewer. After showing him 
             the reult, he was happy with it, gave a few tips and criticism, and told me to continue growing as an artist.</center><br>

        One of my more recent art. In context, I haven't been practicing my art skills or work on any perssonal drawing projects since. I had lost most of my motivation keep getting better because being lock up in 
          your own room due to COVID can get pretty depressing. When my friends show me some of there drawings they have been doing on there free time, I got a bit jealous at how good there art is and how I haven't done anyting.
          So the point of the drawing was mostly to prove to myself that I still got the skills. Along with that, I also wanted to gauge myself to see if I have gotten any better or worse after many months of not working on any 
               personal projects or drawing practice. I personally say that my skills haven't gotten any wose, though there is a noticable differeence in quality from my previuois art work. The two characters are
               from different game franchise that I wanted to interact in a cute way. Nothing more behind it.</center><br>
